<h1>Messi's first club Newell's Old Boys </h1>
<p>
    Lionel Messi, often considered one of the greatest
        footballers of all time, has an illustrious history
        in the world of soccer. Born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina,
        Messi's football journey began at a young age. <br><br>
    Messi joined the youth team of his local club, 
    Newell's Old Boys, at the age of six, showcasing
        extraordinary talent from the start. However, at
        the age of 13, he was diagnosed with a growth 
        hormone deficiency, which could have halted his football career. To pursue better medical treatment and football opportunities,
        Messi and his family moved to Barcelona, Spain.

<h1> Messi joined FC Barcelona</h1>
<p>
In 2000, at the age of 13, Messi joined FC 
Barcelona's famous youth academy, La Masia. 
There, he continued to develop and impress with 
his exceptional skills, speed, dribbling ability, 
and goal-scoring prowess. He quickly rose through 
the ranks, and by the age of 17, he made his first-team
    debut for Barcelona in a friendly match in 2004.
    <br> <br>

    His official debut for Barcelona's senior team 
    came on October 16, 2004, in a La Liga match
    against Espanyol. Messi's talent was evident 
    to the world as he continued 
    to dazzle with his performances on the pitch.

    <p>
    1)Winning numerous domestic league titles (La Liga) and Copa del Rey titles. <br>
    2)Winning UEFA Champions League titles with Barcelona. <br>
    3)Becoming the club's all-time leading scorer. <br>
    4)Winning multiple Ballon d'Or awards (given to the world's best player). <br>
    <br>
    Messi's relationship with the club faced
        challenges in the latter part of his career. Financial constraints and contractual issues led to his departure from Barcelona in August 2021, with the club unable to register a new contract 
    due to La Liga's financial regulations.
